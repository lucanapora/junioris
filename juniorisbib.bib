Part reference, part tutorial, this book thoroughly explains the shift from fixed-functionality graphics hardware to the new era of programmable graphics hardware and the additions to the OpenGL API that support this programmability. With OpenGL and shaders written in the OpenGL Shading Language, applications can perform better, achieving stunning graphics effects by using the capabilities of both the visual processing unit and the central processing unit.   In this book, you will find a detailed introduction to the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) and the new OpenGL function calls that support it. The text begins by describing the syntax and semantics of this high-level programming language. Once this foundation has been established, the book explores the creation and manipulation of shaders using new OpenGL function calls.         OpenGL® Shading Language, Third Edition,  includes updated descriptions for the language and all the GLSL entry points added though OpenGL 3.1, as well as updated chapters that discuss transformations, lighting, shadows, and surface characteristics. The third edition also features shaders that have been updated to OpenGL Shading Language Version 1.40 and their underlying algorithms, including    Traditional OpenGL fixed functionality Stored textures and procedural textures Image-based lighting Lighting with spherical harmonics Ambient occlusion and shadow mapping Volume shadows using deferred lighting Ward’s BRDF model    The color plate section illustrates the power and sophistication of the OpenGL Shading Language.

The purpose of the development of this model is to account for the ambient light in a more accurate way than it is done in Phong illumination model, but without recoursing to such expensive methods as radiosity. In our model we simulate the indirect diffuse illumination coming from the surfaces of the scene by direct illumination coming from the distributed pseudo-light source. The estimation of indirect illumination is based on the concept of obscurance coefficients that resemble the integrated weighted form-factors computed for some vicinity of a given point. The same idea is used to account illumination of a given point (patch) from light sources. This illumination is computed as a sum of direct illumination calculated using the standard local reflection model and empirically estimated indirect illumination based on the same obscurance concept.},

This third edition has been completely rewritten to provide detailed and up-to-date coverage of key concepts, algorithms, technologies, and applications.  The authors explain the principles, as well as the mathematics, underlying computer graphics–knowledge that is essential for successful work both now and in the future. Early chapters show how to create 2D and 3D pictures right away, supporting experimentation. Later chapters, covering a broad range of topics, demonstrate more sophisticated approaches. Sections on current computer graphics practice show how to apply given principles in common situations, such as how to approximate an ideal solution on available hardware, or how to represent a data structure more efficiently. Topics are reinforced by exercises, program­ming problems, and hands-on projects.  This revised edition features New coverage of the rendering equation, GPU architecture considerations, and importance- sampling in physically based rendering  An emphasis on modern approaches, as in a new chapter on probability theory for use in Monte-Carlo rendering  Implementations of GPU shaders, software rendering, and graphics-intensive 3D interfaces  3D real-time graphics platforms–their design goals and trade-offs–including new mobile and browser platforms  Programming and debugging approaches unique to graphics development  The text and hundreds of figures are presented in full color throughout the book.

It provides detailed coverage of both realistic and non-realistic images. This is the third edition of a book which deals with the processes involved in converting a mathematical or geometric description of an object into a visualisation that simulates the appearance of a real object. Traditionally computer graphics has created pictures by starting with a very detailed geometric description, subjecting this to a series of transformations that orient a viewer and objects in 3D space, then imitating reality by making the objects look solid and real - a process known as rendering. Nowadays this is proving insufficient for the new demands of moving computer imagery and virtual reality. Much research is being carried out into how to model complex objects, where the nature and shape of the objects changes dynamically and into capturing the richness of the world without having to model every detail explicitly. This text explores and relates thee resulting in diverse synthesis and modelling methods.},

This is typically done by modelling the surface as a perfect diffuser, sometimes with a specular component added for the simulation of hilights. This paper presents a more accurate function for the generation of hilights which is based on some experimental measurements of how light reflects from real surfaces. It differs from previous models in that the intensity of the hilight changes with the direction of the light source. Also the position and shape of the hilights is somewhat different from that generated by simpler models. Finally, the hilight function generates different results when simulating metallic vs. nonmetallic surfaces. Many of the effects so generated are somewhat subtle and are apparent only during movie sequences. Some representative still frames from such movies are included.},
